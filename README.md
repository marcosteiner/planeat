# Planeat
A system to optimize the habit of eating.

## Perspective
Since we eat daily, one could argue that it is a habit. 

This would shift the thinking to a more long term view of the consumed goods and maybe 
shift the focus away from fast food. 

## Goal
The goal of this system is to explore how much the following can be optimized by looking 
at eating as a habit. 
- Time
- Money 
- Environment (food waste, seasonal, Low in CO2, packaging)
- Fitness goals
- Health

## Time
The following activities of a consumer needed to occur until the food can be consumed:
- Planning the food and ordering it 
- Retrieving it
- Warming it
- Cleaning the Dish

Probably most of these actions could be automated which would mean that the consumer would
probably spend most of his time retrieving the meal. Which, if economically viable could also 
be turned into delivery.

## Money 
Knowing the exact amounts of foods to be prepared should have a positive effect on price.
Service is already mostly automated. Cooking could eventually be automated too.

## Environment
Since the foods only have to be converted to a form in which it has a low expiry according
to demand, a lot of the food should be used.

On the system meals could be suggested according to what is currently seasonal.

Since the food production would be mostly local, very little packaging would be required, 
and transport would be short.

Most of the takeaway meals also cause a huge amount of plastic waste. This could be eliminated 
by motivating customers to use their own reusable tupperware.

## Fitness Goals
Calorie counting would be very easy to implement. Also, data for other nutrients 
could be summarized like protein intake. The system could be improved through feedback
and AI.

## Health 
Through feedback and AI about how the people felt and with the suggestions of other 
organizations about a healthy diet, the health and how people feel could be improved.
